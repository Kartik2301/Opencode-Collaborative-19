Thank you for contributing to the Collaborative-19 repo..

Before making a PR, please read the following guidelines and follow them strictly.

1. Before making a PR ensure that your code builds clean without any errors or warnings, and that it exactly resolves the issue.

2.Remember if someone is assigned an issue, do not put your PR on that, once that person who was assigned the issue leaves, and if the issue 
is still open, then you must claim the issue first and then submit the PR.

3.The mentors of the project have a lot of work in their hands, so it might take a little time to review your PR, so have patience.

4.If you face any difficulty, you can comment or communicate via the official slack channel and discuss with the mentors or other people working on this issue.
